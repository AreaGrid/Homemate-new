# Homemate - Multi-Step Verification System

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive, production-ready multi-step verification system built with React Native and TypeScript. The system provides enterprise-grade security features including phone verification, email verification, document validation, and biometric authentication support.

## Verification System Features

### 1. Phone Number Verification
- International phone number support with country code selection
- SMS OTP verification with 6-digit codes
- Resend functionality with cooldown timer
- Auto-detection of SMS codes where supported
- Rate limiting and security measures

### 2. Email Address Verification
- Real-time email validation
- Email OTP verification system
- Resend email functionality with rate limiting
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 3. Document Verification (In Progress)
- Multiple document type support (passport, driver's license, national ID)
- Camera integration for document capture
- Image quality validation and preview
- File upload with progress indicators
- OCR data extraction capabilities

### 4. Information Review & Submission
- Summary of all collected verification data
- Edit functionality for each verification step
- Final submission with confirmation
- Success screen with next steps

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **React Native 0.79+** with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Redux Toolkit** with RTK Query for state management
- **React Hook Form** with Yup validation schemas
- **React Native Keychain** for secure data storage
- **AsyncStorage** for app state persistence
- **React Navigation 6+** with type safety

### Security Features
- Secure OTP generation and validation
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- Encrypted storage for sensitive verification data
- Session management with timeout handling
- Rate limiting for OTP requests
- Biometric authentication integration
- Proper data encryption for stored information

## Security Implementation

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted using React Native Keychain
- Session tokens stored securely with automatic expiration
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Validation & Error Handling
- Comprehensive input validation with real-time feedback
- Proper error boundaries and fallback UI
- Detailed error messages with actionable guidance
- Network error handling with retry mechanisms

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader support with proper labels
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- Reduced motion support for accessibility preferences

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **iOS Setup** (if targeting iOS)
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   # For iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # For Android
   npm run android
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourapp.com/v1
VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT=300000
OTP_LENGTH=6
MAX_ATTEMPTS=3
```

### API Integration
Update the `verificationService.ts` file to integrate with your backend API:
- Replace mock implementations with actual API calls
- Configure proper authentication headers
- Implement retry logic and error handling

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Coverage
The project includes comprehensive test coverage for:
- Validation utilities
- Custom hooks
- Redux actions and reducers
- Component rendering and interactions

## Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:ios
npm run build:android
```

### Security Checklist
Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Update all API endpoints to production URLs
- [ ] Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Enable code obfuscation
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configure rate limiting on the backend
- [ ] Test biometric authentication on physical devices
- [ ] Validate all security measures are in place
